# Final Project Template

KIEI-451 Winter 2021

Our team consists of:
- Dan Peacock
- Henry Raether 
- Michael Scognamiglio

Our team is excited to build out Project ID 9: a Social Platform for Bars. We will be building a consumer network for the urban social drinker. Our website will allow a user to log-in, select a location from a list to indicate what bar they are in, and update their "Status". Other logged-in users can find that data, and easily locate their friend!'

Our web application is here, that shows you your network's recent bars!: https://play.nativescript.org/?template=play-js&id=qJmQaq&v=3
